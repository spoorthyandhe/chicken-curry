How to do chicken curry?

Marinate the chicken pieces with ginger garlic paste, lime juice and salt. Cover and set aside for 30 mins.
Grind onions, ginger, garlic and green chilies to a fine paste. Set aside.
Heat oil in a pressure cooker or a large heavy bottomed pan. Add cumin seeds. Roughly pound all the whole spices (bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns and cloves) and add to the oil. Once they start to splutter, add the onion paste. Cook the onion paste on a low flame, stirring occasionally, till it is reduced to a golden, brown paste and the oil starts to surface.
Add tomatoes, salt, turmeric powder, red chili powder (if using) and coriander powder. Cook till the tomatoes start melting, and almost form a paste.
Add the chicken, garam masala and Â½ cup water.
Pressure Cooker:
At this stage, if you are using a pressure cooker, place the lid and pressure cook for 3 whistles.
Switch off the flame and let the steam escape before opening the cooker.
Simmer for 5-10 mins on high flame, if required, to thicken the curry (Chicken leaves a lot of water). I didn't need to do this.
Pan Method:
If you are using a heavy bottomed pan, bring the curry to a boil, reduce the heat, cover with a lid and let it cook on medium heat for 20-25 minutes.
Uncover the pan, and cook for another 15-20 minutes till the water evaporates and the curry starts to thicken.
Once the curry is ready, switch off the flame.
In another small pan, heat ghee and add green chilies and ginger. Once they start to splutter and become slightly crisp, switch off the flame and mix the tadka (or tempering) into the curry. Top with coriander.
Let the curry sit for 10-15 minutes before serving. Tastes best with rotis or rice.
